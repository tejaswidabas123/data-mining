## Part 1: Data Preprocessing

#The first part of the project involves data preprocessing. This includes tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the data for model building.


```bash
Rscript part1.R

## Part 2: Model Building
#In the second part, machine learning models are built using preprocessed data. This project uses various models, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, neural networks, and gradient boosting.

## Part 3: Model Evaluation
#Part 3 focuses on evaluating the machine learning models built in Part 2. The evaluation process assesses the performance of these models on a test dataset and computes various metrics.

#To run Part 3:
Rscript part3.R

## Part 4: Performance Metrics
#This section provides detailed calculations for various performance metrics for each model, including True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate, Precision, Recall, F-measure, ROC value, and MCC value.

#To run Part 4:

Rscript part4.R

## Datasets
3This project utilizes a dataset for fraud detection. The exact dataset used can be found in the code provided in the respective parts.
